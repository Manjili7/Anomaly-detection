Anomaly detection in manufacturing

A disentangled-variational-autoencoder, with a temporal convolutional neural network, was used to model and trend tool wear in a self-supervised manner. Anomaly detection was used to make predictions in both the input and latent spaces. The experiment was performed on the UC Berkeley milling data set.

The method achieved a precision-recall area-under-curve (PR-AUC) score of 0.45 across all cutting parameters in the milling data set, and a top score of 0.80 for shallow depth cuts. The study presents the first known use of a disentangled-variational-autoencoder for tool wear monitoring.
